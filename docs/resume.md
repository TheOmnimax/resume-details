## Project experience

### eReader

* Developed full-stack app, using Flutter (Dart) for frontend, and FastAPI Python server hosted on Google App Engine for backend, that allows users to download and read eBooks.
* Implemented BLoC for state management for client app.
* Google Cloud Datastore database to allow users to manage, organize, and retrieve ebooks.
* REST API requests (built in Python using Flask through FastAPI) for client to communicate with server.
* Authentication through Firebase to ensure only authorized users can download new ebooks.
* Created page divider algorithms to read and render ebooks. It worked by rendering a virtual version of the book, counting the number and height of lines, and using that to determine the point of division in the text.

### Boggle

* Developed full-stack app, using Flutter (Dart with BLoC) for frontend, and FastAPI Python server hosted on Google App Engine for backend, that allows users to play Boggle in real-time with friends online.
* Managed shared memory used by a multi-threaded server with coarse-grained locks, to store player and game data.
* Built a polling mechanism via REST API to handle multi-client synchronization on near real-time state updates - player data, player word choices, and game state.
* Used graph data structures (i.e. a trie), and wrote path-finding algorithms to efficiently traverse through the Boggle words solution space and find all possible words, handle game events, and calculate game scores.

### Trivia game

* Developed full-stack app, using Flutter (Dart with BLoC) for frontend, and FastAPI server with Socket.io hosted on Google App Engine for backend that allowed users to play a real-time trivia game online.
* Google Cloud Datastore to store real-time game data. Designed data schemas to manage multiple relational entities that were optimized for high frequency writes.
* Multi-client real-time synchronization with the server managing shared state, maintaining client-server communication using WebSockets, allowing real-time communication.
