## Work experience

### Dobility, Inc



* Responded to support requests submitted by users
  * Completed about 8 tickets per day
  * Generally responded within 1 hour, much faster than 2 hour standard
  * Created thorough, easy-to-follow, yet succinct solutions
  * Ensured user retention by offering superb support for our platformAdded new user segments by expanding capabilities of our software.
    * Created custom solutions for the niche needs of NGOs, furthering the company's social mission.
    * For example, a popular request was for implicit association tests (IAT), where the field only appears on the screen for a short time (about five seconds), and they can either tap the screen or tap a keyboard key to quickly select a choice. With the [timed categories](https://github.com/surveycto/timed-categories) field plug-in, this is now possible in SurveyCTO, bringing us whole new users.
* Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON
  * Used Git and GitHub for version control, code review, and suggestions.
  * Developed field plug-ins that allow users to use timers, counters, filter data, track which links were clicked, find how long a YouTube video was watched for, control phone call recordings, and more.
    * Here is the list of the favorite field plug-ins I developed: [Timed categories](https://github.com/surveycto/timed-categories), [Timed field list](https://github.com/surveycto/timed-field-list), [YouTube detector](https://github.com/surveycto/youtube-detector), [Ranking choices](https://github.com/surveycto/ranking-choices), [Twilio control](https://github.com/surveycto/twilio-control), [Counter with stopwatch](https://github.com/surveycto/counter-with-stopwatch), [Counter with timer](https://github.com/surveycto/counter-with-timer), [Detect clicked link](https://github.com/surveycto/detect-clicked-link), [Timed choice](https://github.com/surveycto/timed-choice), [Text box](https://github.com/surveycto/text-box)

* Developed and hosted webinars and training sessions
  * Developed and hosted 7 webinars
    * For new users, taught about features that they could use in their workflow, so they know if the platform is right for them.
    * For existing users, taught them other features they could be using, so they can continue using the platform, and not look elsewhere for their needs.
    * Here are the webinars I hosted, from newest to oldest (not including training sessions, and the Q&A is cut for the privacy of the attendees): [Enumerator management](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/new-enumerator-management-tools-webinar/), [Implicit association tests](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/iat-plugin-webinar/), [New security settings](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/spring-2021-release-webinar-recording/), [Case management](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/case-management-webinar-recording/), [Web forms](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/web-forms-webinar-recording/), [Overview webinar](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/overview-webinar-2021/) (often shared with prospective users), [Pre-loading data](https://www.surveycto.com/videos/preloading-data-webinar/)

    * [Requesting consent via bulk SMS](https://support.surveycto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047234214-Requesting-consent-via-bulk-SMS) (integration with third-party service)

### LANConnect Systems, Inc

* First line of defense in fixing computer issues.
  * Worked on about 8 client-created tickets per day.
  * Fixed issues briefly yet thoroughly.
  * Ensured clients were all set, so even though I was not brief, it did not seem like I was rushing them.
* Address remote management and monitoring issues (RMMs).
  * These are tickets created automatically whenever an issue is detected, such as a client's computer running low on storage.
  * Completed about 30 per day.
  * Used to be 100s of open RMMs at a time, I brought it down to dozens, or even fewer than 5 at times.
  * I was so efficient at addressing these tickets, that when I went on vacation, other technicians, including those who had been in the job much longer than I had, wondered how I was able to complete so much, and complete tickets faster than they could be created.
  * Addressed issues before clients could notice them, preventing future errors.
  * Ensure clients know we are not just waiting for their calls, but actively monitoring their systems.
* Set up protections and networks.
* Perform other tasks around the office.
  * I get bored doing nothing, so when I was caught up on my other work, I would ask for other tasks, such as cleaning or organizing.
* Learn new services to ensure computer upkeep.

### Best Buy

* Sold home theater systems to customers.
  * Customers walk in expecting to spend about $500, and they would walk away with $2,000 worth of products and services, and they would be happy about it.
  * Sold over $1,000,000 in first year, despite starting half-way through the year.
  * Came in 2nd of 300 sales associates in holiday quarter, winning Best Buy's Achievers award.
  * Asked thorough questions to find the customer's needs, and find the solution that works well for them.
  * Jumped to the next sale as soon as another customer is ready to be helped.
* Rotated through other store areas to fill gaps in service.
  * Helped in departments that were busy and lacking sales associates to help.
  * Handed customer over to sales associates in that department when they became available, to ensure keeping good relations with team members.
* Completed acclaimed Best Buy Sales Induction Program, learning important sales techniques.
